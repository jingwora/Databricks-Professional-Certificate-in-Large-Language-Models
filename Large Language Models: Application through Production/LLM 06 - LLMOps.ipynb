Our pipeline will be familiar to you from previous modules: summarization of news articles using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.  But in this walkthrough, we will be more rigorous about LLMOps.\n\n**Develop an LLM pipeline**\n\nOur LLMOps goals during development are (a) to track what we do carefully for later auditing and reproducibility and (b) to package models or pipelines in a format which will make future deployment easier.  Step-by-step, we will:\n* Load data.\n* Build an LLM pipeline.\n* Test applying the pipeline to data, and log queries and results to MLflow Tracking.\n* Log the pipeline to the MLflow Tracking server as an MLflow Model.\n\n**Test the LLM pipeline**\n\nOur LLMOps goals during testing (in the staging or QA stage) are (a) to track the LLM's progress through testing and towards production and (b) to do so programmatically to demonstrate the APIs needed for future CI/CD automation.  Step-by-step, we will:\n* Register the pipeline to the MLflow Model Registry.\n* Test the pipeline on sample data.\n* Promote the registered model (pipeline) to production.\n\n**Create a production workflow for batch inference**\n\nOur LLMOps goals during production are (a) to write scale-out code which can meet scaling demands in the future and (b) to simplify deployment by using MLflow to write model-agnostic deployment code.  Step-by-step, we will:\n* Load the latest production LLM pipeline from the Model Registry.\n* Apply the pipeline to an Apache Spark DataFrame.\n* Append the results to a Delta Lake table.\n\n### Notes about this workflow\n\n**This notebook vs. modular scripts**: Since this demo is in a single notebook, we will divide the workflow from development to production via notebook sections.  In a more realistic LLM Ops setup, you would likely have the sections split into separate notebooks or scripts.\n\n**Promoting models vs. code**: We track the path from development to production via the MLflow Model Registry.  That is, we are *promoting models* towards production, rather than promoting code.  For more discussion of these two paradigms, see [\"The Big Book of MLOps\"](https://www.databricks.com/resources/ebook/the-big-book-of-mlops).\n\n### ![Dolly](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/llm/dolly_small.png) Learning Objectives\n1. Walk through a simple but realistic workflow to take an LLM pipeline from development to production.\n1. Make use of MLflow Tracking and the Model Registry to package and manage the pipeline.\n1.

development, our goal is to move code and/or models from Development to Production.  In order to do so, we must test the code and/or models to make sure they are ready for Production.\n\nWe track our progress here using the [MLflow Model Registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html).  This metadata and model store organizes models as follows:\n* **A registered model** is a named model in the registry, in our case corresponding to our summarization model.  It may have multiple *versions*.\n   * **A model version** is an instance of a given model.  As you update your model, you will create new versions.  Each version is designated as being in a particular *stage* of deployment.\n      * **A stage** is a stage of deployment: `None` (development), `Staging`, `Production`, or `Archived`.\n\nThe model we registered above starts with 1 version in stage `None` (development).\n\nIn the workflow below, we will programmatically transition the model from development to staging to production.  For more information on the Model Registry API, see the [Model Registry docs](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html).  Alternatively, you can edit the registry and make model stage transitions via the UI.  To access the UI, click the Experiments menu option in the left-hand sidebar, and search for your model

It is very important to ensure that the environments for development, staging, and production match.\n* For this demo notebook, everything is done within the same notebook environment, so we do not need to worry about libraries and versions.  However, in the Production section below, we demonstrate how to pass the `env_manager` argument to the method for loading the saved MLflow model, which tells MLflow what tooling to use to recreate the environment.\n* To create a genuine production job, make sure to install the needed libraries.  MLflow saves these libraries and versions alongside the logged model; see the [MLflow docs on model storage](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#storage-format) for more information.  While using Databricks for this course, you can also generate an example inference notebook which includes code for setting up the environment; see [the model inference docs](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.html#use-model-for-inference) for batch or streaming inference for more
